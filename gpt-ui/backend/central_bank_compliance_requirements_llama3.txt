# 🏦 Llama3-Aware Compliance Guidelines for Digital Wallet

These compliance checks are based on your app's current schema:

### Database Tables:
- `query_app_user`: Stores user info (id, username, email)
- `query_app_transaction`: Stores each transaction (user_id, amount, date)
- `query_app_transactionhistorylog`: Logs changes to transactions

---

## 1. KYC & Identity Checks
**Goal**: Ensure all users have valid identification and contact info

- ✅ All users must have a **valid, non-null email** address  
  ➤ SQL: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM query_app_user WHERE email IS NULL OR email = '';`

- ✅ No duplicate usernames should exist  
  ➤ SQL: `SELECT username, COUNT(*) FROM query_app_user GROUP BY username HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`

---

## 2. Transaction Volume & Risk Limits
**Goal**: Monitor and restrict potentially risky financial behavior

- ✅ Users should not exceed $10,000 in transactions per day  
  ➤ SQL:  
  ```sql
  SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS daily_total  
  FROM query_app_transaction  
  WHERE transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE  
  GROUP BY user_id  
  HAVING daily_total > 10000;
